What is the use of Python Virtual Environment?
  A virtual environment in Python is like a separate workspace where you can install packages without affecting your main system. It lets you: 
i) Isolate dependencies(avoid conflicts between projects)
ii) Use different Python versions/packages per project
iii) Keep things clean(easier to share and manage code)

What is an IDE ?
  An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is also a software tool that helps programmers write, debug, and run code efficiently.
  - Code editor(with syntax highlighting and auto complete)
  - Debugger(to find fix errors)
  - Built-in terminal & tools(for running code,version control)
